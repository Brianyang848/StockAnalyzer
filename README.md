# StockAnalyzer

This is an AI-driven Stock Analyzer

I used an OpenAI API for this project.

How it works:

1. Set up API to use LangChain, stock list to analyze, dates to compare

2. install required libraries

3. Fetch stock Data from yfinance

4. Calculate and Visualize KPI (Key Performance Indicators)

5. Portfolio Optimization -> Best risk-reward scenario, balance stock --> shows how much to invest in each company

6. Black-Litterman Model -> combine market data with personal belief!

Thank you!!
